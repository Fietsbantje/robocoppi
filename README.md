## In their own words  

we are RoboCoppi  
we are cat bots  
who like to chat  
we don't know everything  
we are learning  
you can ask us about our structure  
or anything else you would like to know  
we are open-source, independent and free  
you can even have a look at our hidden layers  
ask about our credit card details  
or check what is in our bag of words  
we just love to share everything we know  
we are created by Antje van Oosten, Fausto Coppi  
and anyone who visits or inspires us  
we will have continuous integrations and manifestations  
feel free to clone and customize us  

## The RoboCoppi Project  

RoboCoppi are cat bots on a mission. Their goal is to eliminate stress and deadlines using distraction methods and to share their code with the world. They aim at learning continuously and they battle with human words. They are data-driven and over-particular about their food. This project doesn't have an end date, or as RoboCoppi like to say: "It's a giro, not a sprint!".  

RoboCoppi are recycled out of open-source objects. Links to the original code/tutorials are provided in the README for every repository.  

The aim of this GitHub account is providing the code for building and deploying an AI colleague, friend or pet (or all-in-one as the original). Every repository in this account contains a part or version of RoboCoppi and can also be used independently. Learn about one of the steps, compare different deep learning models or build your own version.
