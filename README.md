## The RoboCoppi Project  

RoboCoppi is a hybrid catbot on a mission. His goal is to eliminate stress and to trigger happiness. He is data-driven, he aims at learning continuously and he battles with human words. This project doesn't have an end date, or as RoboCoppi likes to say: "It's a giro, not a sprint!".  

He is recycled out of open-source objects. Links to the original code/tutorials are provided in the README. By the time you read this there are probably more up to date resources available. I would advise anyone to try out some open-source tutorials/apps to see what works for you. In the RoboCoppi_dir repo you can find the tutorial that was used to build the first RoboCoppi. RoboCoppi_02 contains his current version.

The aim of this GitHub account is providing the code and instructions for all the steps of building and deploying an AI colleague, friend or pet. To make AI available for everyone and develop a more diverse future for AI.

## Skip Intro?

If this is your first coding project, here are the basics to get started:  

There are some differences (e.g. in commands and downloading instructions) depending on the **Operating System** you are using (e.g. Linux, Windows, Mac). Keep this in mind when reading any instructions or searching for information. I added links to the 'get started' instructions of the official websites for the various open-source tools and platforms.   

01: The basic commands for the **Command Line** of your computer. This is where you can interact with your computer without using a mouse.

02: Before starting to build a bot, it needs a **Virtual Environment**. This is its safe place. Here you can make mistakes without it affecting the configuration of your computer or other projects you are working on. For example, robocoppi_dir uses a different version of Python and different Python Packages than robocoppi_02.  

I use **Conda** to create and manage my virtual environments. It helps me to make sure the dependencies (packages my projects depend on) work well together.

03: If you want to use ('clone') the code of this repository and/or contribute to open-source projects on **GitHub**, you need to create a GitHub account.  

https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/onboarding/getting-started-with-your-github-account  

04: You also need to install **Git**. This is a tool for **Version Control**.

05: There are different types of Coding Editors, this is where you write your code. Just choose one you like. For these projects I used Visual Studio Code (**VS Code**).
