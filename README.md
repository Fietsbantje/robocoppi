## In his own words  

we are RoboCoppi  
we are a cat bot  
who like to chat
we don't know everything  
we are learning  
you can ask us about our structure  
or anything else you would like to know  
we are open-source, independent and free  
you can even have a look at our hidden layers  
ask about our credit card details
or check what is in our bag of words  
we just love to share everything we know  
we are created by Antje van Oosten, Fausto Coppi  
and everyone else who plays with us  
we will have continuous integrations and manifestations  
feel free to clone and customize us  

## The RoboCoppi Project  

RoboCoppi is a cat bot on a mission. His goal is to eliminate stress and deadlines using distraction methods and share his code with the world. He aims at learning continuously and he battles with human words. He is data-driven and over-particular about his food. This project doesn't have an end date, or as RoboCoppi likes to say: "It's a giro, not a sprint!".  

RoboCoppi is recycled out of open-source objects. Links to the original code/tutorials are provided in the README for every repository.  

The aim of this GitHub account is providing the code for building and deploying an AI colleague, friend or pet (ar all-in-one as the original) from scratch. Every repository in this account contains a part or version of RoboCoppi and can also be used independently. You can learn about one of the steps, compare different deep learning models or build your own version.
