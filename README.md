## In his own words  

I am RoboCoppi  
a cat bot 
who likes to chat  
I don't know everything  
I am learning  
you can ask me anything  
I am open source, independent and free  
you can even have a look at my hidden layers  
ask about my credit card details  
or check what is in my bag of words  
I just love to share everything I know  
I am created by Antje van Oosten, Fausto Coppi  
and anyone who interacts with me   
I will have continuous integrations and manifestations  
feel free to clone and customize me  

## The RoboCoppi Project  

RoboCoppi is a cat bot on a mission. His goal is to eliminate stress and deadlines, using distraction methods. He aims at learning continuously and he battles with human words. He is data-driven and over-particular about his food. This project doesn't have an end date, or as RoboCoppi likes to say: "It's a giro, not a sprint!".  

He is recycled out of open-source objects. Links to the original code/tutorials are provided in the README for every repository.  By the time you read this there are probably more up to date resources available. I would advise anyone to try out some open-source tutorials/apps to see what works for you. 

The aim of this GitHub account is providing the code for all the steps of building and deploying an AI colleague, friend or pet (or all-in-one as the original). Every repository in this account contains a part or version of RoboCoppi and can also be used independently. Learn about one of the steps, compare different deep learning models or build your own version.  

## Skip Intro?

If this is your first coding project, here are the basics to get started:  

There are some differences (e.g. in commands and downloading instructions) depending on the **Operating System** you are using (e.g. Linux, Windows, Mac). Keep this in mind when reading any instructions or searching for information. I added links to the 'get started' instructions of the official websites for the various open-source tools and platforms.   

01: The basic commands for the **Command Line** of your computer. This is where you can interact with your computer without using a mouse.

02: Before starting to build a bot, it needs a **Virtual Environment**. This is its safe place. Here you can make mistakes without it affecting the configuration of your computer or other projects you are working on. For example, robocoppi_dir uses a different version of Python and different Python Packages than robocoppi_02.  

I use **Conda** to create and manage my virtual environments. It helps me to make sure the dependencies (packages my projects depend on) work well together.

03: If you want to use ('clone') the code of this repository and/or contribute to open-source projects on **GitHub**, you need to create a GitHub account.  

https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/onboarding/getting-started-with-your-github-account  

04: You also need to install **Git**. This is a tool for **Version Control**.

05: There are different types of Coding Editors, this is where you write your code. Just choose one you like. For these projects I used Visual Studio Code (**VS Code**).
